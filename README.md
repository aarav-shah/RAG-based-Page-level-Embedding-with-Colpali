# RAG-based-Page-level-Embedding-with-Colpali

This repository contains the implementation of a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) page-level embedding system utilizing Colpali and GPT-4. The project enables efficient document retrieval by creating page-level embeddings and indexing graphical images as page representations. It supports interaction with the embedded content using advanced LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4.

## Features

- **RAG Document Retrieval**: Integrates RAG to retrieve relevant content from indexed pages.
- **Page-level Embedding**: Uses Colpali to generate embeddings at a granular, page-by-page level for better content retrieval.
- **Image-Based Indexing**: Embeds entire document pages as images to retain graphical details during retrieval.

## Technology Stack

- **Colpali**: For generating embeddings and indexing images of document pages.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Provides intelligent, natural language responses to user queries.

## Usage
## Embedding Documents:

Use Byaldi to convert documents into images and store them.

## Running Queries

The RAG framework retrieves the most relevant page-level embeddings.
GPT-4 processes the prompt and generates a response based on retrieved content.
